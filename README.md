The purpose of this system is to monitor data by using sensors and it is divided into two categories; 
first is software development which this website is all about, users will see the dashboard by logging in which will be provided by the admin, also I added some features such as
~CRUD OPERATION
~NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
~USER ROLE AUTHENTICATION
~QUERY AND AJAX OPERATION
seconde is hardware components, where I used
~Arduino uno for microcontroller
~Ultrasonic sensor that measures the distance
~ESP WIFI module transmits data from a microcontroller to the database
~RGB LED that blinks as an indicator
~etc..

The system uses a framework like Bootstrap and other tools so it will lessen the time of development and provide a quality of works.
